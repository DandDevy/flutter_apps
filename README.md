# flutter apps

Some educational and random fun apps

## Purpose

I would like to improve my skills where it comes to frontend stuff. I wanted to try out flutter rather than react native because to be honest it just looked nicer. I am familiar with android studio and making android apps in java and a little in kotlin.
